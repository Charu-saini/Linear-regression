# Linear-regression
End-to-end implementation of Linear Regression from scratch with gradient descent, loss visualization, and regression line plotting

This project is a complete end-to-end implementation of Linear Regression without using machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn. Everything is coded from scratch to demonstrate the working principles of the algorithm.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

* Implemented Linear Regression using only Python, NumPy,seaborn, scipy and Matplotlib.

* Computed cost function (MSE) manually.

* Implemented Gradient Descent for parameter optimization.

* Visualized loss vs. iterations and gradient behavior.

* Plotted the best-fit regression line on the dataset.

* Calculated model parameters (Î¸ values) from scratch.

* Compared predictions with the actual data.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations:

* Loss curve to show convergence.

* Gradient plots for better understanding of optimization.

* Regression line plotted on training data.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack:

* Python

* NumPy (for numerical operations)

* Matplotlib (for plotting and visualization)

* Seaborn (for advanced data visualization and statistical plotting)

* SciPy (Used for scientific computations and optimization tasks)

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

This project is mainly for educational purposes to understand how Linear Regression works under the hood before using high-level ML libraries.
